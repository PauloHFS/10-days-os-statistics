# Day 3: Cards of the Same Suit

You draw cards **2** from a standard **52**-card deck *without* replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

### Solution

The first card drawn will be from any of the **4** suits and there will be **51** cards left in the deck, only **12** of which match the drawn card's suit. The probability of the second card being of the same suit is **12/51**.
