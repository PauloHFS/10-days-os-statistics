# Day 3: Conditional Probability

Suppose a family has **2** children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

### Solution

**Sample Space**:
$$
S=\{BB,BG,GB,GG\}
$$
**Event**:
$$
E=\{BB\}
$$

$$
P(BB|B)=\frac{P(B|BB)\times P(BB)}{P(B)}=\frac{1\times \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{4}{3}=\frac{1}{3}
$$
